## 5x5 Tic-Tac-Toe

5x5 Tic-Tac-Toe grid, with four in a row required to win. Followed Kenny Yip's 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial to start, but made it 5x5 on my own and added restart button.
Great learning experience, code may be inefficient/unoptimized.

<!-- ## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies). -->
